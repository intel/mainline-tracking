NAME
       Uintr - overview of User Interrupts

DESCRIPTION
       User Interrupts (Uintr) provides a low latency event delivery and inter
       process communication mechanism. These events can be delivered directly
       to userspace without a transition to the kernel.

       In  the  User  Interrupts  hardware  architecture, a receiver is always
       expected to be a user space task. However, a user interrupt can be sent
       by  another  user  space  task,  kernel  or  an external source (like a
       device). The feature that allows another  userspace  task  to  send  an
       interrupt is referred to as User IPI.

       Uintr  is  a  hardware  dependent,  opt-in  feature. Application aren't
       expected or able to send or receive  interrupts  unless  they  register
       themselves with the kernel using the syscall interface described below.
       It is recommended that applications wanting to use User Interrupts call
       uintr_register_handler(2) and test whether the call succeeds.

       Hardware  support  for  User  interrupts  may  be  detected using other
       mechanisms but they could be misleading and are generally not needed:
        - Using the cpuid instruction (Refer  the  Intel  Software  Developers
       Manual).
        -  Checking  for the "uintr" string in /proc/cpuinfo under the "flags"
       field.


       Applications wanting to use Uintr  should  also  be  able  to  function
       without  it  as well. Uintr support might be unavailable because of any
       one of the following reasons:
        - the kernel code does not contain support
        - the kernel support has been disabled
        - the hardware does not support it


   Uintr syscall interface
       Applications can use and manage Uintr using the system calls  described
       here.   The  Uintr  system  calls  are  available only if the kernel is
       configured with the CONFIG_X86_USER_INTERRUPTS option.

       1)  A  user  application   registers   an   interrupt   handler   using
       uintr_register_handler(2).  The  registered  interrupt  handler will be
       invoked when a user interrupt is delivered to  that  thread.  Only  one
       interrupt  handler  can  be  registered by a particular thread within a
       process.

       2) Each thread that registered a handler  has  its  own  unique  vector
       space  of  64  vectors.  The  thread can then use uintr_create_fd(2) to
       register a vector  and  create  a  user  interrupt  file  descriptor  -
       uintr_fd.

       3)  The  uintr_fd is only associated with only one Uintr vector.  A new
       uintr_fd must be created for  each  of  the  64  vectors.  uintr_fd  is
       automatically  inherited  by forked processes but the receiver can also
       share the uintr_fd with potential senders using any of the existing  FD
       sharing  mechanisms  (like pidfd_getfd(2) or socket sendmsg(2)). Access
       to  uintr_fd  allows  a  sender  to  generate  an  interrupt  with  the
       associated  vector.  Upon  interrupt delivery, the interrupt handler is
       invoked with the vector number pushed onto the stack  to  identify  the
       source of the interrupt.

       4)  Each  thread has a local flag called User Interrupt flag (UIF). The
       thread can set or clear this flag to enable or disable interrupts.  The
       default value of UIF is always 0 (Interrupts disabled). A receiver must
       execute the _stui() intrinsic instruction  at  some  point  (before  or
       anytime  after  registration)  to  start  receiving user interrupts. To
       disable interrupts during critical sections the  thread  can  call  the
       _clui() instruction to clear UIF.

       5a)  For  sending a user IPI, the sender task registers with the kernel
       using uintr_register_sender(2). The  kernel  would  setup  the  routing
       tables to connect the sender and receiver. The syscall returns an index
       that can be used with the 'SENDUIPI <index>' instruction to send a user
       IPI.   If  the receiver is running, the interrupt is delivered directly
       to the receiver without any kernel intervention.

       5b) If the sender is the kernel or an external source, the uintr_fd can
       be  passed  onto the related kernel entity to allow them to connect and
       generate the user interrupt.  <The exact details of this API are  still
       being worked upon.>

       6)  The  receiver  can block in the kernel while it is waiting for user
       interrupts to get delivered using uintr_wait(2). If  the  receiver  has
       been  context switched out due to other reasons the user interrupt will
       be delivered when the receiver gets scheduled back in.

       <The behavior when the receiver has made  some  other  blocking  system
       call like sleep(2) or read(2) is still to be decided. We are evaluating
       if a thread made another blocking syscall  should  be  interrupted  and
       woken  up  when a user interrupt arrives for that thread. uintr_wait(2)
       has been implemented as a placeholder in the meantime.>

       7) The sender and receiver are expected to coordinate and then call the
       teardown syscalls to terminate the connection:
         a. A sender unregisters with uintr_unregister_sender(2)
         b. A vector is unregistered using close(uintr_fd)
         c. A receiver unregisters with uintr_unregister_handler(2)

       If  the  sender  and  receiver  aren't  able to coordinate, some shared
       kernel resources between them would  get  freed  later  when  the  file
       descriptors get released automatically on process exit.


       Multi-threaded  applications  need to be careful when using Uintr since
       it is a thread specific feature. Actions by one thread don't reflect on
       other threads of the same application.


   Toolchain support
       Support  has  added  to  GCC(11.1)  and Binutils(2.36.1) to enable user
       interrupt intrinsic instructions and compiler flag (-muintr).

       The "(interrupt)" attribute can be used to compile a function as a user
       interrupt  handler. In conjunction with the 'muintr' flag, the compiler
       would:
         - Generate the entry  and  exit  sequences  for  the  User  interrupt
       handler
         - Handle the saving and restoring of registers
         - Call uiret to return from a user interrupt handler

       User    Interrupts    related   compiler   intrinsic   instructions   -
       <x86gprintrin.h>:

       _clui() - Disable user interrupts - clear UIF (User Interrupt Flag).

       _stui() - enable user interrupts - set UIF.

       _testui() - test current value of UIF.

       _uiret() - return from a user interrupt handler.

       _senduipi <uipi_index> -  send  a  user  IPI  to  a  target  task.  The
       uipi_index is obtained using uintr_register_sender(2).


   Interrupt handler restrictions
       There are restrictions on what can be done in a user interrupt handler.

       For  example,  the  handler  and  the functions called from the handler
       should only use general purpose registers.

       For   details   refer   the   Uintr   compiler    programming    guide.

NOTES
       Currently, there is no glibc wrapper for the Uintr related system call;
       call  the system calls using syscall(2).
