Date:		June 2021
KernelVersion:	5.14
Contact:	dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org
Description:	RO. Energy input of device in microjoules.

		The returned textual representation is an unsigned integer
		number that can be stored in 64-bits.  Warning: The hardware
		register is 32-bits wide and can overflow by wrapping around.
		A single wrap-around between calls to read this value can
		be detected and will be accounted for in the returned value.
		At a power consumption of 1 watt, the 32-bit hardware register
		would wrap-around approximately every 3 days.

		Only supported for particular Intel i915 graphics platforms.

Contact:	dri-devel@lists.freedesktop.org
Description:	RW. Card reactive sustained  (PL1/Tau) power limit in microwatts.

		The power controller will throttle the operating frequency
		if the power averaged over a window (typically seconds)
		exceeds this limit.

		Only supported for particular Intel i915 graphics platforms.
