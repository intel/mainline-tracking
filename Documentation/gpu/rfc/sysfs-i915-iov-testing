Description:
		The sysfs "iov" directory is used as root of all driver specific
		attributes used to manage and examine device support for the I/O
		virtualization (IOV).

		Note that "prelim_" prefix used here indicates that this version
		of the sysfs ABI is still preliminary and subject to change.

		mode: (RO) string
			Shows IOV mode (if any) of the device or the driver.

			Intel GVT-g is a full GPU virtualization software
			solution, supported starting from 5th generation of Intel
			Core(TM) processors with Intel Graphics processors.

			The Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) extension to
			the PCI Express (PCIe) specification suite, is supported
			starting from 12th generation of Intel Graphics processors.

			"GVT" - DRM device is running as GVT-g guest.

			"SR-IOV PF" - DRM device is running on PCI Function that
				      supports the SR-IOV capabilities, known as
				      Physical Function (PF)

			"SR-IOV VF" - DRM device is running on PCI Function that
				      is associated with a PF, known as Virtual
				      Function (VF)

Description:

		pf/
			The sysfs "pf" directory holds attributes specific to the
			PF and will be available only when mode is "SR-IOV PF".

		vf1/
		vf%/
			The sysfs "vf1".."vfN" directories hold attributes for
			the VFs, where VFs are numbered according to the PCI
			specification starting from 1 to "sriov_totalvfs", and
			will be available only when mode is "SR-IOV PF".

		pf/gt%/
		vf%/gt0/
		vf%/gt%/
			The sysfs "gt%" directories hold attributes specific to
			the device GT tile. Root tile is represented as "gt0" and
			is always present. If remote tiles are also present and
			enabled they are represented as "gt1", "gt2, ...

Description:

		auto_provisioning: (RW) bool
			Controls whether the PF driver shall perform automatic
			provisioning of the VFs when no manual provisioning was
			performed but VFs are being enabled.

			When this flag is true, VFs will be provisioned with
			fair amount of hard resources (like GGTT or LMEM), but
			any scheduling parameters (like execution time) will
			not be modified.

			This flag will be automatically turned off on any
			attempt of manual provisioning of the VF using other
			provisioning attributes.

			This flag can be always turned off.
			This flag can be manually turned on only if all VFs are
			fully unprovisioned, otherwise it will return -ESTALE.

			Backlink to the PCI device entry representing this PF.

Description:

		ggtt_spare: (RW) integer 0..U64_MAX
			Total size of the GGTT address space (in bytes) that PF
			shall preserve for its own use. PF shall refuse VF GGTT
			provisioning if remaining GGTT after such provisioning
			will be smaller than this value.

			Default value is minimal GGTT size as required by the PF.

			PF's minimal GGTT size depends on the platform or driver
			implementation and can be reinforced by writing 0 to this
			attribute.

			Requested size may be aligned per HW/FW/SW requirements.
			If requested size is smaller than minimum then -EINVAL
			error will be returned.

		lmem_spare: (RW) integer 0..U64_MAX
			Total size of the LMEM blocks (in bytes) that PF shall
			preserve for its own use. PF shall refuse to provision
			VF with LMEM if remaining available LMEM after such
			provisioning will be smaller than this value.

			This attribute is only available on discrete platforms.

			Default value is minimal LMEM size as required by the PF.

			PF's minimal LMEM size depends on the platform or driver
			implementation and can be reinforced by writing 0 to this
			attribute.

			Requested size may be aligned per HW/FW/SW requirements.
			If requested size is smaller than minimum (but not zero)
			then -EINVAL error will be returned.

		contexts_spare: (RW) integer 0..U16_MAX
			Number of the GuC submission contexts that PF shall
			preserve for its own use. PF shall refuse VF contexts
			provisioning if remaining available contexts after such
			provisioning will be smaller than this value.

			Default value is minimal number of contexts as required
			by the PF.

			PF's minimal contexts number depends on the platform
			or the driver implementation and can be reinforced by
			writing 0 to this attribute.

			Requested number may be aligned per HW/FW/SW requirements.
			If requested count is smaller than minimum (but not zero)
			then -EINVAL error will be returned.

		doorbells_spare: (RW) integer 0..U16_MAX
			Number of the GuC doorbells that PF shall preserve for
			its own use. PF shall refuse VF doorbell provisioning if
			remaining available doorbells after such provisioning
			will be smaller than this value.

			Default value is minimal number of contexts as required
			by the PF.

			PF's minimal contexts number depends on the platform
			or the driver implementation and can be reinforced by
			writing 0 to this attribute.

			Requested number may be aligned per HW/FW/SW requirements.
			If requested count is smaller than minimum (but not zero)
			then -EINVAL error will be returned.

Description:
		Set of the per-GT policy attributes that corresponds to the
		configuration KLVs supported by the GuC.

		sched_if_idle: (RW) bool
			This attribute controls whether strict scheduling is
			enabled whereby any VF that doesn't have work to submit
			is still allocated a fixed execution time-slice to
			ensure active VFs execution is always consitent even
			during other VF reprovisiong or rebooting events.
			Changing this param impacts all VFs and takes effect
			on the next VF switch event.

			Default is false (disabled).

		engine_reset: (RW) bool
			This attribute controls whether to reset utilized HW
			engine after VF switch to clean up any stale HW
			registers left behind by the previous VF.

			Default is false (disabled).

		sample_period_ms: (RW) integer 0..1000
			This attribute controls a the sample period for tracking
			adverse event counters. A sample period is the period in
			millisecs during which events are counted and the total
			is checked against threshold. The sample period is
			continuous, i.e. not only during the time-slice of a VF,
			but across globally. This is applicable for all the VFs.

			Default is 0 (disabled).

			0 = disabled
			1..1000 = sample period in [ms]

		control: (WO) string

			This attribute allows admin to pause, resume or stop
			handling submission requests from given VF.

			This operation will be performed on all GTs where
			VF is provisioned.

			Writes to this attribute may fail with:
				-EIO if GuC refuses such control

			"pause" = will temporarily pause VF scheduling on GuC.
			To restore VF scheduling admin shall use "resume".

			"resume" = will resume VF scheduling on GuC.

			"stop" = will stop completely VF scheduling on GuC.
			To restore VF scheduling admin must trigger VF FLR.
