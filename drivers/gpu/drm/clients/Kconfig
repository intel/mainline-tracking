	  This option enables the DRM client library and selects all

	  Drivers that support in-kernel DRM clients have to select this
	  option.

	  Enables the DRM client selection. DRM drivers that support the
	  default clients should select DRM_CLIENT_SELECTION instead.

	  Choose this option if you have a need for the legacy fbdev
	  support. Note that this support also provides the linux console
	  support on top of your modesetting driver.

	  If in doubt, say "Y".

config DRM_FBDEV_OVERALLOC
	int "Overallocation of the fbdev buffer"

	  Defines the fbdev buffer overallocation in percent. Default
	  is 100. Typical values for double buffering will be 200,
	  triple buffering 300.

config DRM_FBDEV_LEAK_PHYS_SMEM

	default n
	help
	  In order to keep user-space compatibility, we want in certain
	  use-cases to keep leaking the fbdev physical address to the
	  user-space program handling the fbdev buffer.
	  This affects, not only, Amlogic, Allwinner or Rockchip devices
	  with ARM Mali GPUs using a userspace Blob.
	  This option is not supported by upstream developers and should be
	  removed as soon as possible and be considered as a broken and
	  legacy behaviour from a modern fbdev device driver.

	  Please send any bug reports when using this to your proprietary
	  software vendor that requires this.

	  If in doubt, say "N" or spread the word to your closed source
	  library vendor.
