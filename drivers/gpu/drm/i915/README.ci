CI-only patches

Some times patches need to be temporarily added to overcome regressions that
can't be quickly fixed to unblock CI. Some times we also want to bring the real
fix from other upstream branches before they propagate to Linus' master branch
(or stable releases).

This section is the equivalent of the topic/core-for-CI in upstream.
