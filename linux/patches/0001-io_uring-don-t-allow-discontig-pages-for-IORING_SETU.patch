Subject: [PATCH] io_uring: don't allow discontig pages for
 IORING_SETUP_NO_MMAP

io_sqes_map() is used rather than io_mem_alloc(), if the application
passes in memory for mapping rather than have the kernel allocate it and
then mmap(2) the ranges. This then calls __io_uaddr_map() to perform the
page mapping and pinning, which checks if we end up with the same pages,
if more than one page is mapped. But this check is incorrect and only
checks if the first and last pages are the same, where it really should
be checking if the mapped pages are contigous. This allows mapping a
single normal page, or a huge page range.

Down the line we can add support for remapping pages to be virtually
contigous, which is really all that io_uring cares about.
