Subject: [PATCH] interconnect: qcom: sc8180x: Mark CO0 BCM keepalive

[ Upstream commit 85e985a4f46e462a37f1875cb74ed380e7c0c2e0 ]

The CO0 BCM needs to be up at all times, otherwise some hardware (like
the UFS controller) loses its connection to the rest of the SoC,
resulting in a hang of the platform, accompanied by a spectacular
logspam.

Mark it as keepalive to prevent such cases.
